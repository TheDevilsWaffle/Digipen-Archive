                <h1>War Games</h1>

                <h3>Chaturanga</h3>
                <p>Father of Chess, Chaturanga means guadripartite (divided into four parts). It was used to descibe an Indian army from Vedic times, which had four parts: 1 elephant, 1 chariot, 3 cavalry, and 5 foot soldiers. The board was called the ASHTAPADA(eight square). Its pieces are very similar to Chess: Raja/King, Mantri/Counselor/Queen, Gaja/Elephant/Bishiop, Asva/Knight, Ratha/Chariot/Rook, and Pedati/Infantry/Pawns.</p>

                <h3>Shogi</h3>
                <p>Shogi is played on a 9x9 square board. Pieces promote on the opposite third of the board. All pieces promote to Gold General except as noted. Captured pieces may be dropped as your own as your turn, once per turn. The pieces are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>King: like a normal king</li>
                        <li>Rook: moves like normal rook, promotes to Dragon King, which gains ability to move 1 space diagonal</li>
                        <li>Bishop: moves as normal bishop, promotes to Dragon Horse, which gains ability to move 1 space orthagonally</li>
                        <li>Gold General</li>
                        <li>Silver General</li>
                        <li>Knight</li>
                        <li>Lance</li>
                        <li>Pawn</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h3>Xiangqi</h3>
                <p>Game is played on a board of 9x10 lines with the pieces played on the points, or intersections of the line. The center of the board is separated by the river, which Elephants may not cross.
                <ul>
                    <li>General: move one space orthogonally, must stay within palace</li>
                    <li>Mandarin: move one space diagonally, must stay within palace</li>
                    <li>Elephants: move two spaces diagonally, must stay on their side of the river</li>
                    <li>Horses: move as Knight in Chess, but intervening space must be empty</li>
                    <li>Soldiers: move one space forward until crossing the river, where it gains ability to move sideways</li>
                    <li>Chariots: move as Rook in Chess</li>
                    <li>Cannons: move as a Chariot, but must jump over another piece to capture</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <h3>Maharajah &amp; The Sepoys</h3>
                <p>A variant from India in the 19<sup>th</sup> Century. One player has a full set of pieces, where the other has only the Maharajah, which can move like a Queen and Knight combined.</p>

                <h3>Gala (Farmer&rsquo;s Chess)</h3>
                <p>A variant from Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. Object is to capture both enemy Kings (no check). Central cross zone causes pieces to deflect (rooks and bishops trade movement roles in this zone).</p>

                <h3>Courier Game</h2>
                <p>Appeared in Germany in the early 13<sup>th</sup> Century, and was played for several centuries. Probable source of the modern Bishop. Featured a enlarged board, Queen moves 1 space diagonally or 3 on the first move, Bishop moves 2 squares diagonally and jumps, Courier that moves like a modern Bishop, Jester, that moves 1 space orthogonally, Sage that moves like a King, and a double steop rule for the King's and Queen's Pawns.</p>

                <h3>Circular/Byzantine Chess</h3>
                <p>Played as early as 10<sup>th</sup> Century in Persia. Played with the same pieces as Shantranj. Variant called Citadel for each side in the center of the board. Reaching an opponent&rsquo;s Citadel with your King forces a draw.</p>

                <h3>Stratego</h3>
                <p>Often cited as a modern game derived from Chess, but with imperfect information. Stratego is a licensed cariant derived from L&rsquo;attaque, published in Europe in 1910 by Jumbo, designed by Mdme. Hermance Edan in 1908. Milton Bradley licensed and published the game as Stratego in 1961.</p>

                <h2>Design Principles</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Chess is a <strong>symmetric</strong> game with <strong>asymmetric</strong> piece abilities.</li>
                    <li>Chess is a game of <strong>perfect information</strong></li>
                    <li>Chess is a game with a goal of <strong>player elimination</strong> through a <strong>mechanic of deterministic attrition</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Games of Postion</h2>
                <h3>Wei-Ch&rsquo;i or Go</h3>
                <p>Origins of Wei-Ch&rsquo;i date to Chinese writings dating from 635 (AD or BCE?). First known books on the game from 618 &ndash; 906. Arrived in Japan around 500 BCE. By the end of the first millennium commoners were playing the game in Japan. State school founded in a6<sup>th</sup> Century&mdash;first professional gamers! Go espouses estehtics throughout the game.</p>
                <p>Go is all about territory. The goal is to capture territory by occupying the intersections of two lines, so that adjacent line combinations create an area of adjacent stones.</p>
                <p>Go is layed on a 19 x 19 board, although it is sometimes practiced on a 9 x 9 board.</p>
                <p>Go is the root for Othllo (a.k.a. Reversi) and Blokus (game of the year for 1999).</p>

                <h3>Gomoku</h3>
                <p>Gomoku (or Renju or Gobang) is Japanese for "five in a row". Generally considered a children's game in Asia (as opposed to Go). Gomok means "five pieces". It is traditionaly played on a Go board with Go stones. The goal is to be the first to get 5 in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Rows of more than 5 (called overlines) do not count. Players are not permitted to create open-ended forks of 3 stones each. Three and four or four and four are allowed, however. It is a lot lie Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four.</p>

                <h3>Pente</h3>
                <p>Pente is an adapttion of Gomoku by Gary Gabrel in 1977. Pente was acquired by Parker Brothers in 1983. The main difference in the game is that it allows capturing pairs of stones. Caprturing 5 pairs is an alternate win condition.</p>

                <h3>Morris Games</h3>
                <p>Morris games were found at the Temple at Kurna, Egypt, as the incomplete Alquerque board from 1400 BCE. The game had made its way to China as Luk tsut K&rsquo;ic by 500 CE. Games were disconvered in Bronze Age Ireland. In all versions of the game, players take turns adding stones to the board.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Three Men&rsquo;s Morris: First to get 3 in a row wins, like Tic-Tac-Toe.</li>
                        <li>SIx Men&rsquo;s Morris: After all pieces are placed, you can move to one adjacent place. Getting 3 in a row let&rsquo;s you remove an opponent's piece</li>
                        <li>Nine Men&rsquo;s Morris:</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>Connect Four</h3>
                <p>First trademarked and publishd by Milton Bradley in 1974. Public domain versions pre-existed this version by many different names. Connect Four was released on the Microvision handheld game console, first with interchangeable cartidges and the TI-99 in 1979.</p>

                <h2>Games of Attrition</h2>
                <h3>Mancala</h3>
                <p>Mancala comes from the Arabic word, meaning litterally "to move". The use of mancala as a name for the game can be traced to Thomas Hyde, a professor of Arabic at the University of Oxford who wrote two books in Latin about games.</p>
                <p>Fragments of pottery boards found in Ethiopia and Eritrea dating from the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> Centruies prior to Isam. May be a mancala type game&hellip;</p>
                <p>The idea is simple: you carve out pits in the ground ( or in a wooden block) and "sow" seeds or pebbles into each pit. The idea is to drop your stone into an occupied pit and &helip;</p>

                <h2>Elements of Position and Attrition in Computer Games</h2>

                </ul>

                <h3>Tangrams</h3>
                <p>Tangrams were invented in CHina posibly during the Eastern Zhou period. The earliest known Chinese book on the subject was dated 1813, but it was already quire old by then. Puzzle game that enjoyed great popularity rom 1815 through the 1820&rsquo;s in Europe and the US.</p>

                <h3>Tetris</h3>
                <p>Go master long ago identified that there are 12 distinctive patterns (pentominoes) that can be formed by 5 connected stones on a Go board. 1970;s: Alexey Pajitnov discovers a set of pentominoes (polyominoes with 5 squares) in a toy store in MOscow and fals in love with the puzzle. 1984: Alexey Pajitnov worked at th Dorodnitsyn Computing Center in the area of AI, where he coded the first version of Tetris (named for "tetra-" prefix and his favorite sport  tennis) in 2 weeks. Bootleg versions of the game begin to leak all over Russia and into Europe.</p>

                <h3>Dominoes</h3>
                <p>Dominoes first came to Europe through Italy in the early 18<sup>th</sup> Century. They lost their series designation, added blanks, and removed duplicates. Probably named for the balck and white domino mask worn in Venetian Carnical, which in turn was named for the black hood with white interior worn by French clergy during winter. Dominoes are traditionally made of bone, ivory, or wood. Thus, the draw pile is often called the &ldquo;woodpile&rdquo; or &ldquo;boneyard&rdquo;.</p>

                <h4>Inuit Dominoes</h4>
                <p>See slides&hellip;</p>

                <h2>Games with Dominoes</h2>
                <p>Generally most dominor games fall into one of two types:
                <ul>
                    <li>Block Games; Objective is to empty your hand first. All dominoes are distributed.</li>
                    <li>Draw Games: Objective is to score the most points during play, usually by summing the open ends. Players start with a hand of dominoes and draw more during play.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <h4>Basic Domino Games</h4>

                        <ul>
                            <li>This is the most common version of Dominoes in the US.</li>

                <h3>Mahjong</h3>
                <p>Around 1610, the Chinese document <em>Yeh-tzu</em> describes Matiao, an almost cetain direct ancestor of the game Mahjong. <strong>Matiao was a trick-taking game for four players, played with four-suited money cards. THree of the four matiao suits resemble the three suits of the mah-jongg. Coins correspond to Bams; Coin Strings Myriads correspond to Craks. The deck composition and game play is quite diferent.</strong> The game first came into general wareness around the late 1880&rsquo;s.</p>
                <p>There are three origin theories:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Mahjong probably originated in the provinces near Shanghai because no reconds of mahjong are found in any other part of China before 1900.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>A rival theory credits one or more inventors in Ningpo with the act of transposing playing cards used for the game of Matiao onto ivory and banboo about 1870 or 1880 as this is the area where playing cards were first recreated in ivory tablets.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Bo specific origin</strong></li>
                </ul></p>

                <h4>The Rise &amp; Fall of Mahjong</h4>
                <p>In 1920 Joseph Park Babcock introduced the game to the US in 1920, when he renamed it to Mah-Jongg and published a book that simplified and standarized the rules, <em>ules of Mah-Jongg</em>. In 1922, Parker Brothers tried a test market of the game, but it had disappointing results. In 1923, seeing the fad pick up, Parker Brothers started selling sets from $2.50 to $150. By 1922, ranked 6<sup>th</sup> in value of exports from Shanghai at $1,505,00 (equivilent to $14.3 Million). In 1923, the Department of Commerc reported that large quantities of bone were being exported from Kansas City and Chicago to China in order to turn out more sets. In 1924 the fad began to cool, and by 1929 the game had almost entirely faded from public awareness.</p>
