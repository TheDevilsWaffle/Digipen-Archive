DETAILS:
	While the game is not complete, the idea is to make a space flight racing game with limited energy management between your shields, lasers, and throttle. Holding throttle will slowly drain the power from your shields/lasers, while letting go of throttle and breaking will recharge your shields/lasers. Boosting to go faster will dramatically increase the drain rate of your shields/lasers.
