<p>These are sounds that will be used for the <strong>Rollie-Ouille</strong>. These sounds are not final, feel free to add to the options available.</p>
<ui>
	<li><em>snd_rollie_detectPlayer_XX</em>: This is a noise that the enemy emits when it has detected a player and begins to chase after them. We can either choose one sound or randomly select them.</li>
	<li><em>snd_rollie_movement:</em> This noise can be played when the enemy is moving, possibly at a reduced level (either through code or we can resample the noise at a lower volume in Adobe Audition/Audacity).</li>
	<li><em>snd_rollie_death</em>: This noise can be played when the enemy dies.</li>
	<li><em>snd_rollie_rolling_XX:</em> This noise can be played on a loop for when the enemy is rolling around. </li>
