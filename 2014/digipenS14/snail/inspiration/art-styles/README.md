<h1>Inspiration\Art-Styles</h1>
<p>This directory contains images from popular video games to serve as art style inspiration for our game. The images are listed out below along with notes explaining what elements we could possibly draw from when developing an art style for <em>Snail</em>.</p>

		<h3>Fez</h3>

		<p>While <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fez_(video_game)" target="blank">Fez</a> is more of a retro style pixel game, the art style is cute and intricate. There is a lot of detail and personality in the art style, especially in the animations of the various creatures in the game. The colour palette is bright and friendly, something I think <em>Snail</em> could benefit from. This art style takes more time than it looks to do right, but is acheivable.</p>

		<h3>Fly'n</h3>

		<p><a href="http://www.flyn-devblog.com/en">Fly'n</a> is a beautiful looking game and conveys an amazing sense of atmosphere. I think the soft gradients, colour palette, and general look would be perfect for conveying a awe-inspiring yet dangerous world through the eyes of our snail. This being said, the amount of work to acheive this style would take quite a lot of time and commitment. I believe this is an art style we should strive for, but not kill ourselves trying to emulate it.</p>

		<h3>Guacamelee!</h3>

		<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guacamelee!" target="_blank">Guacamelee!</a> is the original inspiration for my geometric-ish snail that I made for the trailer pitch. Guacamelee has a definite style and look, complimented by a vibrant colour palette that is used to distinguish the living and dead worlds in the game. I view this game mostly as the starting point for the geometric yet organic feel that I think <em>Snail</em> should have.</p>

		<h3>Lovers In A Dangerous Spacetime</h3>
		<img src="http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/XlWfqDMSK0M/maxresdefault.jpg" width="600" alt="Love In A Dangerous Spacetime">
		<p><a href="http://www.asteroidbase.com/dangerous-spacetime/" target="_blank"></a>Lovers In A Dangerous Spacetime</p> is interesting in how bravely it uses bright colours, despite the fact that the game is meant to be dangerous (usually denoted with muted and dark colours). While the forms are not that special, I think the interesting glow of things might be something to keep in mind if we have dark levels or special buggy enemies. Reminds me of neon signs.</p>

		<h3>Spelunky HD Version</h3>
		<img src="http://snackedup.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/spelunky-hd-comparison.png" width="600" alt="Spelunky Comparison">
		<p>Interesting in both its original and HD version, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spelunky">Spelunky</a> is my biggest inspiration for how challenging the game should be. The art style is fun and cute, which extremely betrays the difficulty of the game, creating the sort of "easy to pick up and play, difficult to master" concept for <em>Snail</em>.</p>

		<h3>Spirits</h3>
		<img src="http://cdn.mactrast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/spirits1-582x363.jpg" width="600" alt="Spirits">
		<p>A rare gem, I think <a href="http://www.spacesofplay.com/spirits/" target="_blank">Spirits</a> has an exceptional look to its environment/level design. Like a mix between the colourfulness of <em>Fly'n</em> and the mystery of <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limbo_(video_game)" target="_blank">LIMBO</a></em>, I really want the aesthetics of our level design for <em>Snail</em> to draw heavily from this game. The aesthetics are so clean and make the environment memorable without distracting the player from the enemies/player/powerups/etc&hellip;</p>
