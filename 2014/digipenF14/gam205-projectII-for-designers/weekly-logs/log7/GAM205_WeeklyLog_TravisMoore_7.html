<h3>What I'm Planning On Doing Next Week</h3>
<p>Iâ€™m currently working on establishing a style guide and will be assisting Garrett and Jason on creating the vertical slice of our game that we will be presenting for our milestone presentation.</p>

<h3>What I Discoverd This Week</h3>
<p>Once again I've learned just how much time my other classes take away from my ability to get a lot of work done for our game. GAT211 and CS176 took up the majority of my time up until Thursday. Eric and Jason dropped GAT211 and should have more time freed up for our game, and I kind of wish I could be doing the same. I'm going to have to free up more time somewhere or possibly sacrifice quality from my other classes' assignments.</p>

<h3>Asking and Giving Help</h3>
<p>I worked with Garrett, Eric, and Jason on CS homework. I also asked Eric for help in understanding his code in our game.</p>
