<h3>What I'm Planning On Doing Next Week</h3>
<p>I’m currently working on implementing new AI behaviors that can be attached to a central enemy AI manager. I will also be involved in level design for our vertical slice.</p>

<h3>What I Discovered This Week</h3>
<p>I’ve learned that while I can plan on devoting time on the game project there will always be weeks where other classes, namely GAT211, which will take priority. This semester has been an education in trade-offs where one week I have the time to devote to one set of classes and in other weeks I do not. This balance is difficult to maintain, but necessary if I am to pass all of my classes.</p>

<h3>Asking and Giving Help</h3>
<p>I worked with Eric going over the previous week’s code for the mushroom and blade trap enemy. I also did playtesting with Garrett and Chris Christensen for our GAT211 Team Fortress 2 projects.</p>
