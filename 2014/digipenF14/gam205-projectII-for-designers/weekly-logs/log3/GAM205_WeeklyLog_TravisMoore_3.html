<h3>What I'm Planning On Doing Next Week</h3>
<p>I'm planning on creating mockups of the style that I've been researching. This will help to establish a style guide so that we will have a clear and consistent idea of how our game is going to look.</p>

<h3>What I Discoverd This Week</h3>
<p>Once again, this week was full of projects and homework for other classes. I thought I would have time to do more for our game time, but unlike all the time I had last week, I just could not get around to doing as much as I'd like. However, compared to last week we spent much more time together as a team and are getting to know each other better.</p>

<h3>Asking and Giving Help</h3>
<p>I asked Eric and Garrett for help with scripting in the zero engine and provided help when I could. I also showed Eric how to merge in Git and provided him a ride home one day when he needed it.</p>
