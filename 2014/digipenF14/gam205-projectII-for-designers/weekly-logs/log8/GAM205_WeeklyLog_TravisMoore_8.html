<h3>What I'm Planning On Doing Next Week</h3>
<p>I’m currently working on establishing a style guide and will be assisting Garrett and Jason on creating the vertical slice of our game that we will be presenting for our milestone presentation. I am also creating particles for use in our game.</p>

<h3>What I Discoverd This Week</h3>
<p>I’ve learned how important it is to be at all of our team meetings. This has been an issue with members of our team. Whenever we do meet we get things accomplished, but not every member of the team always shows up to the meetings. This needs to be corrected because it is causing problems.</p>

<h3>Asking and Giving Help</h3>
<p>I worked with Garrett, Jason C. and Jason G. on GAT240 homework. Jason C. helped me with Collision Tables in the Zero Engine.</p>
