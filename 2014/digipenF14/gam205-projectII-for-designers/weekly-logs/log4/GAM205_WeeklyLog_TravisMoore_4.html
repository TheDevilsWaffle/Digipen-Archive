<h3>What I'm Planning On Doing Next Week</h3>
<p>I’m currently working on creating as many mockup/concept sketches for our team artist, Billy, so that he can start to model art assets for our game. I’d also like to be involved in the main world map creation, as well as begin programming for our game.</p>

<h3>What I Discoverd This Week</h3>
<p>I’ve learned a lot about scope and communication this week. In the previous weeks our team has split up and communication has been lacking. With the milestone project being due our team spent much more time together and I feel like we were all more productive for it. We really need to make sure we communicate better as a team and all meet up often to do our team game and other homework for our classes.</p>

<h3>Asking and Giving Help</h3>
<p>I provided and asked for help on ActionScript 3 XML files with fellow team member, Garrett, and fellow BAGD, Berne. I also asked for help from Eric for where to start for programming for our team game.</p>
