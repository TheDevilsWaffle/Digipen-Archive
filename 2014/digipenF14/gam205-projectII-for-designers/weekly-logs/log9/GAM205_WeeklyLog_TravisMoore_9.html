<h3>What I'm Planning On Doing Next Week</h3>
<p>I’m currently working on the mushroom AI scripts, in particular behavior to track the player, decide between attacks to perform and the lunge and air-headbutt attack. I am also scrapping the style guide for now and instead going to be focusing on level design and enemy AI.</p>

<h3>What I Discovered This Week</h3>
<p>I’ve learned that roles can change. I feel like I wasted so much time doing concept art only to just now learn that my team will not be using my concept art in the game at all. I guess my new role should be level design/script monkey because my art will not be in the game after all. I cannot help but be a little upset about it.</p>

<h3>Asking and Giving Help</h3>
<p>I worked with Garrett, Jason C. and Jason G. on features for our milestone presentation. Helped a freshman out with a zero engine/zilch scripting problem he was having. Helped and was helped by Jason C. on CS116 homework. I helped put together the power point with Garrett. I helped Garrett and Berne with CS176 homework.</p>
