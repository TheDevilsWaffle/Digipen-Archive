<h3>Total Hours: 18 hours</h3>

<h3>What I'm Planning On Doing Next Week</h3>
<p>I believe everything is nearly done for the UI, except for the options menu and keyboard/gamepad support (I’ve contacted Eric and Jason several times about this, but have yet to hear back from them). Aside from finishing up this, I plan on being a part of the GDD and Game Pitch Document creation, especially when it comes to the layout of this documentation.</p>

<h3>What I Discovered This Week</h3>
<p>I learned how to put together quite a decent UI for a menu system. In particular I’ve gotten better about using actions to create animated transitions like translating, scaling, and fading in and out.</p>

<h3>Asking and Giving Help</h3>
<p>Our team was mostly gone this week, so although I’ve asked for help, I have received no help this week or helped anyone else.</p>
