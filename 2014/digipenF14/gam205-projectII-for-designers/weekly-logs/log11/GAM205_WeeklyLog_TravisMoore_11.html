<h3>Total Hours: 12.5 hours</h3>

<h3>What I'm Planning On Doing Next Week</h3>
<p>We’re calling enemy AI complete at this point and focusing purely on level design for our intro and dungeon levels. I will be assisting Jason and Eric with the intro and dungeon level design, creating a UI system, and also making in-game dialog busts of the mom, dad, diviner, and monk.</p>

<h3>What I Discovered This Week</h3>
<p>Team One on One’s are awesome and we needed to do it sooner. We are so much better off for doing this.</p>

<h3>Asking and Giving Help</h3>
<p>I asked for help from the team on CS homework and also gave help to Chris Christensen for CS.</p>
