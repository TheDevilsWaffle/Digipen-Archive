<h3>What I'm Planning On Doing Next Week</h3>
<p>I'm planning on establishing an art style and developing a style guide so that we will have a clear and consistent idea of how our game is going to look.</p>

<h3>What I Discoverd This Week</h3>
<p>This week was full of projects and homework for other classes. I though I would have time to do more for our game time, but unlike all the time I had last week, I just could not get around to doing as much as I'd like.</p>

<h3>Asking and Giving Help</h3>
<p>I assisted Eric in ensuring our team logo design would be printed correctly. I also asked for help for my team in playtesting my combat system for GAT211.</p>
