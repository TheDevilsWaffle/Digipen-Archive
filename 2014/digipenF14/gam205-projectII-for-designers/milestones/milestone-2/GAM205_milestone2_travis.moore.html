<h3>Milestone 2 Notes</h3>
<p>The lead up to Milestone 2 was frought with all kinds of team related issues. More than anything else, our team is having a difficult time trying to get everyone together in the same room at once. In particular, it has been difficult to get Eric to simply show up to school. However, when we do finally get together, lots of work is able to be accomplished. Milestone 2 was also set back in many ways by the other assignments that we all have in other classes. The pressure became so difficult for 2 of our team members that they have decided to drop GAT211 so that they can instead spend time that time working on our game.</p>
<h3>Personal Evaluations:</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Eric:</strong> Once again, Eric is a brilliant guy and an amazing programmer. When we are able to get him to focus, the amount of quality work that Eric can produce is outstanding. However, as essential as Eric is, he has been causing quite a lot of frustration within the team. I know that he means well, and can definitely work well on his own, but he is not meshing well with the team as a whole, and I fear that his inability to consistently show up to team meetings, let alone classes/school, will be his undoing. Now that he has one less class to worry about maybe he'll be better about showing up to things. I also plan on spending the next 3 weeks trying to motivate him to show up to classes and stay on target. I know he is rather sensitve when it comes to critisim and I think that he feels the team's frustration and retreats rather than confronts the problem. This being said, I believe there's hope that he can continue to be a part of the team, it'll just take a lot of paitence.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Jason:</strong> Jason has put a lot more time into the game since the last milestone. He is really taking charge on the narrative and now that he one less class to worry about he seems more comfortable. Jason does a good job about putting in a lot of effort and his work on the dog AI shows this. Jason is also really good about sharing with the team and works well with all of us. He is becoming increasingly frustated with Eric, but is definitely trying his best to be paitient. I really appreciate having him on the team.</li>
	<li><strong>Garrett:</strong> Garrett has also put a lot of effort into the game since the last milestone. While his frustration with Eric is not well kept, he has been assiting Eric in providing 3D models for the game and did a wonderful job on the Diviners temple. My biggest concern for Garrett is his lack of code in the game and his temper with Eric. As the producer he is trying his best to keep us all together, but I think his contempt for Eric is hurting us (even if it might be justified). I know Garrett is a good worker and will do whatever it takes to get the job done, I just hope he is able to calm down about Eric. Garrett is always really good about showing up on-time to everything and communicating, which is something I really appreciate.</li>
	<li><strong>Billy:</strong> As it turns out we had to fire our artist, Billy, for never showing up to any meetings and never producing any work. He was given 9 weeks to produce a single 3D model for us and never delivered.</li>
	<li><strong>Travis:</strong> I thought I'd include myself on this, just to give a personal evaluation. I started of slowly this milestone but I have definitely picked up the pace as this milestone came closer. I cannot help but feel that my place in the team has been shaken up since the start and I am a little frustrated by this. I have a BFA in graphic design and I have a clear vision of how this game should look. However, despite how quickly I can produce great quality 2D art work for our game, Eric still insists that we use 3D models in the game. This would not be such a big deal if not for the fact that Garrett and Eric do not consult me over the 3D models that they make. I am supposed to be the Art Lead and my concept art is being overlooked. This is incredibly frustrating, especially because I keep getting assigned to do concept art that is not being used in our game! I finally voiced my thoughts on this and they are now allowing me to work on different scripts in the game. I have since added a button ui system, a level managerment system, cheat code system, and just finished a completely broken down enemy behavior system that can be used to construct enemies and assign them behaviors as needed. I am happy to make this kind of progress in usefulness, but I am still upset about being the Lead Artist and not getting the kind of respect I should be getting with that title.</li>
