<h3>Milestone 1 Notes</h3>
<p>The lead up to Milestone 1 has had its ups and downs. I feel like our team started out strong but then communication started to break down in weeks 2 and 3. It was hard to meet up as a group and we really started to learn how difficult creating this game is on our own. I feel like we should be further along, but reigning in the team focus is difficult for our producer, Garrett. In particular, it is hard to get Eric and Jason to meet up with us, and when we do get them to show up, usually one or the other shows up. My biggest concern at this point is team cohesion, which I'll break down by person:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Eric:</strong> Eric is a smart guy and a talented programmer, so it makes sense that he is our technical director. However, I think Eric feels like he does not need to share programming this game with any of us (with the exception of the small task of the camera that he has given to Jason). He is not open to sharing what is going on with his code, saying things like: "it's complicated" instead of taking the time to explain to us. We want to help and be a part of the game, but Eric seems reluctant to share. Because he is talented and has a strong drive he has gotten a lot of work done, but our team is not participating in programming like we should be. I would also like to see him show up for team homework sessions, as he has yet to do so.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Jason:</strong> Aside from doing the camera, Jason has been responsible for the narrative. Thankfully he shares this responisibility well with the team and we have all been able to give our insight into how we think the game should be put together. He works well with the team, but like Eric, I'd like to see him show up more to all of our gatherings. His health is a concern, as it can hinder his ability to work. However, he has a great team attitutde, so when he is around he works well with others.</li>
	<li><strong>Garrett:</strong> I know Garrett more than any other member of the team. He has the monumental task of keeping us all on task and is definitely doing the best of his ability to keep us all on schedule. He is starting to become impatient with Eric, and is often shutdown with asking Eric for understanding on programming. He is reliable and shows up to every meeting and works well with everyone. I think his frustration is justified, as it is hard to get us all together.</li>
	<li><strong>Billy:</strong> I barely met with Billy 3 days ago. I'm glad he's finally participatig with the team, but it is too soon to tell just how well he'll be able to produce for the team. I am hoping for the best, but I am worried that we'll be asking too much from him. I really wish we'd just stick with 2D instead of 3D art assets, as I'd be able to pump out assets for us quickly instead of just doing concepts and mockups.</li>
	<li><strong>Travis:</strong> I thought I'd include myself on this, just to give a personal evaluation. I've been doing my best to show up to all meetings, with the exception of the weekend that I've been out of town. My work has primarily been in art and design, but I've been a big participant in how the story will work. I've had no participation in programming, which bothers me. I really want to learn to be a better programmer, which is why I accepted working with Eric. Unfortunately, it has been difficult to get him to share. I will have to push harder so that I can play a part in that area of our team. I have been busy working on art and design, and I am responsible for the team logo and the geometric art style for our game. I always feel like I can be doing more, and I feel like doing this report has shown me where I can improve for the next milestone report.</li>
