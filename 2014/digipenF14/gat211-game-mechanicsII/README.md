<h3>Combat Systems III</h3>

<h4>Advanced Melee Combat</h4>
<p>So basically, advanced melee combat can be done in a style similar to "Rock Paper Scissors":
	<blockquote>Rock Paper Scissors<br>Rock->Scissors->Paper->Rock or A->B->C->A</blockquote>
	This is a non-sovlable mechanic (MMRPS). Usually rock beats scissors, but it does not always have to be this way. Perhaps the system can give rock a major advantage, like an 80% chance to always beat scissors. This way is interesting because it gives the underdog, scissors, a chance to come back.</p>
<h4>Activated Abilities</h4>
<p>Abilities can be limited by timers, resources, drawbacts, etc&hellip; However, limiting an ability so that it can occur only after a particular condition is very interesting.
<blockquote>Example: Only after a hit, only after a critical, only after a fumble, obly after a parry/dodge, only after x&hellip;</blockquote>
Players will feel smart and competent if we reward them for connection the dots.</p>

<h3>Linear Maps w/ Ranged Combat</h3>

<h4>Ranged Combat</h4>
<p>Impact/affect other players at a distance. This is not a standalone mechanic, it is added to other mechanics/effects.
	<ul>
		<li>Ranged damage (cannnon, bow)</li>
		<li>Ranged status effects (gas grenade)</li>
		<li>Ranged 'misc' (can of green paint)</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h4>MDE of Ranged Combat</h4>
<p>AS a mechanic, range can help create many interesting dynamics:
	<ul>
		<li>Area Control (i do not want to go where they can hoot me)</li>
		<li>Where do we fight? (I want to run away if I have better range, 'kiting')</li>
		<li>Maps (I want to fight where the map supports my amoun of range)</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h4>A New Stat</h4>
<p>With the introduction of a new statistic, <strong>RANGE</strong>, combat once agin changes radically.</p>

<h4>Asymmetrical Ranges</h4>
<p>One of the biggest effects of range is when two characters have different range stats. The character with the <strong>longer range</strong> has the advantage, while the other character must close the distance or run away. Think of the MDE effects of different range values.</p>

<h4>Range Brackets</h4>
<p>Range does not have to be all or nothing. It can be broken into range brackets

<blockquote>point blank, short, medium, long, extreme, etc&hellip;</blockquote>

Different brackets can affect hit probability and/or damage. If you need more than five range brackets, you should use a formula instead, or a table derived from a formula. The more complicated you make range brackets, the more work you are asking from your players (especially in board games).</p>

<h4>Aiming</h4>
<p>Many games imply actions must be taken to accurately aim a ranged attack. THe default could be aimed, while multiple un-aimed shots could be done in one turn (at a penalty). The default could be unaimed, with bonuses for taking actions to aim. Bracing, bipods, tripods, etc&hellip; can all be used to afect aimed shots as well.</p>

<h4>What does missing mean?</h4>

<p>Unlike melee combat, many ranged systems need to know what a miss 'means'.
	<ul>
		<li>Do misses possibly hit other targets?</li>
		<li>Do effects have areas/is there 'splash damage'?</li>
		<li>Should missing do no damage? Less damage?</li>
		<li>What happens when the effect of an action is greater than its range?</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<blockquote><strong>Game Idea</strong>Missing with large guns destroys environment as well as layers of ground, revealing lava eventually. Employ friendly fire? Missing sends zombies towards the area of the noise? Towards the attacker? Consider how in depth "missing" can be for the theme of the game. Fire sets areas on fire (temporary DoT or area denial), rock knocks people back and requires being broken, Wind pushes projectiles/players x distance over x turns, and water umm...something.</blockquote>

<h4>Ranged Defenses</h4>

<p>Many defenses that work in melee combat do not make as much sense in ranged combat. 
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Dodging</strong> tends to work fine, although it is hard to dodge fast moving projectiles.</li>
		<li><strong>Blocking</strong> works as well, but most shields cannot stop modern ranged weapons.</li>
		<li><strong>Parrying</strong> is almost impossible, but could work against thrown weapons.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h4>Cover</h4>
<p>The real defense against ranged attacks is cover, and preferably hard cover. Any type of cover makes you harder to hit if it makes you harder to see. Hard cover makes you even harder to hit because the target area is smaller (this can be modeled with hit locations). Consider allowing stealth to be used as a defnse when under cover. Stealth creates a "I do not know where you are" type of cover.</p>

<h4>Line of Sight</h4>
<p>Rules are needed for all the edge cases.
<blockquote>Cuenter to Center? Edge to edge? Center to Edge? How do we determine what is correct line of sight?</blockquote>
When does your system employ partial cover? Does this elimiate line of sight or only partial damage?</p>

<h4>Ranged Attacks in Melee Combat</h4>
<p>Making ranged attacks while ngaged in melee combat is difficult. Most combat systems will either not allow it, will penalize it, or wil cause an opportunity attack when it is attempted. This must be accounted for when analying ranged combat systems.</p>

<h4>Area Effect Attacks</h4>
<p>Attacks can affect a whole area instead of a single target (this could apply to melee attacks, as well). These areas of effect can have a variety of chapes: circle, square, cone, line, etc&hellip; Their damage can be even across the area or drop-off with distance from the center/starting point, like in an explosion.</p>

<h4>Ranged Combat Map Considerations</h4>
<p>Line-of-sight now really matters. Sniping ports, ill-zones, choke-points, all typs of terrain are impotant to consider. Terrain that blocks movement and melee, but not ranged attacks need to be thought about. Areas with cover and areas without create spots in the battlefield. How do area effect attacks interact with the map?</p>

<h4>Intensity curve effects of ranged</h4>
<p><em>Example:</em> Spikes when the first unit is 'in range'. Again, when the second unit is in range and combat cn go back and forth. Each movement into or out of range. Impact of AoE/full effect versus partial effects. Changes in range 'category'. Visual/audio/mechanical clues about range.</p>
