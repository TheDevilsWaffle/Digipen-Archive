<h3>The Sphinx &amp; Pyramids of Giza</h3>
<h4>Pyramids of Giza</h4>
<p>The largest of the 3 is called the Great Pyramid of Giza and is the only surving structure on the list of the  Wonders of the Ancient World. The capstone of the pyramids was plated with god, silver, or electrum. 2 million blocks of stone at an average of 2.5 tons for each block. The first pyramid in Egypt was a step pyramid. A Pharaoh is buried inside. Limestone on the outside, with granite on the inside. Many theories as to how the pyramids were made. Straight ramp, spiral ramp, and internal ramp theory, and water theory with canals.</p>
<h4>Sphinx: 2540BC</h4>
<p>Largest monolith statue in the world. Faces due east, and has a small temple housed between the paws. 20,000 ton statue that took over a million man hours to carve. Was possibly brightly painted. Was buried and excavated over a long period of time.</p>
<h4>King Tutankhamun Burial Tomb</h4>
<p>The Annex, the Antechamber, the Burial Chamber, and the Treasury make up the four rooms in the sub 1000 feet tomb of King Tutankhamun. Notable for how intact the burial chamber was compared to other kings.</p>
<h4>The Lighthouse of Alexandria</h4>
<p>THe city of ALexandria was founded by Alexander the Great in 332 BC. Coins have the lighthouse depicted on them, despite the lighthouse not existing today. One of the 7 Wonders of the Ancient World. Built by Ptolemy I in 290 BC. Used as the model for the first minarets by early Islamic Mosques. Built with stone, lead mortar, and faced with white marble. The four corners of the lower part of the tower have the statue of Triton (he's a merman!). Zeus or Poseidon on top of the lighthouse. Remaining stones of the lighthouse were used to build Qaitbay Citadel in 1480. There is also a tomb based on the lighthouse called Pharos of Abusir. Architecturally significant structure responsible for the inspiration behind other structures.</p>
<h4>The Library at Alexandria</h4>
<p>The first library/university was the Library at Alexandria. Built by Ptolemy and officials would confiscate books to add to the library. Potentially held 500,000 papyrus scrolls. Partially burned down by Julius Caesar in 48 BC. The remaining works were destroyed by the Christians in 480 AD and/or the Persians in 616 AD.</p>
<h4>Hanging Gardens of Babylon</h4>
<p>One of the 7 Wonders of the Ancient World. Built by Nebuchadnezzar II in 605 BC. Probably made of clay and straw bricks that were dried in the sun, with stones used for the supporting archways and terraces. The gardens were probably watered using a screw pump. Probably destroyed by an earthquake. Other theories include that it was bulit by Sennacherib in Ninevah, not in Babylon.</p>
<h4>Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacan, Mexico</h4>
<p>The main street is called the 'Avenue of the Dead', which is where the Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacan is located. Temple platforms and dwellings remains around the Pyramid of the Sun. Murals decorate the interiors at Teotihuacan. The Avenue of the Dead is aligned to the setting sun on August 13 (the start of the Mayan calendar) and April 29. Many burials of sacrificed children, adults, and animals.</p>
<h4>Machu Picchu in Peru</h4>
<p>It is often called the 'Lost City of the Incas'. The city was abandonned for reasons unknown. It was built for the Inca Emperor Pachacuti in 1438. It is the most well known icon of the Incan civilization. Constructed entirely of local stone with no mortar in trapexoidal doorway and window 'A' shapes that help prevent collapse. Stone blocks were fractured into the desired sizes and then moved to the building site. The Incas used a techinque called Ashlar, in which blocks of stone are cut to fit together tightly wtihout mortar. Also referred to as Polygonal Masonry. Terraces were built first to help prevent soil erosion. Water supplied by natural springs and still works today. There are over 200 structures with 3 main areas. The three main structures are Inti Watana (calendar/clock), Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the 3 Windows.</p>
