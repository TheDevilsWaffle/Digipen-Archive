Use reference images.

Start by thinking about how many verts you will need (look at top view).

use edge loops to add in divisions or cut faces tool to cut a straight line through a polygon.

to get a shape for indent grab the vertices and use edge loop to create the inner shape.

Normals (faces) can be hardened or softened to adjust their edge quality (under normals menu). This affects the rendering but not the model itself.
