<h3>Total Hours: 7.5 hours</h3>

<h3>What I'm Planning On Doing Next Week</h3>
<p>The UI refactor is complete so Iâ€™ll be focusing my efforts on the ending dungeon theme and design. </p>

<h3>What I Discovered This Week</h3>
<p>To be honest I have been mostly upset with our team falling back into old habits and showing up late consistently for meetings. It has brought my overall mood down and makes me not want to contribute at all.</p>

<h3>Asking and Giving Help</h3>
<p>No help asked or given to my teammates this week.</p>
