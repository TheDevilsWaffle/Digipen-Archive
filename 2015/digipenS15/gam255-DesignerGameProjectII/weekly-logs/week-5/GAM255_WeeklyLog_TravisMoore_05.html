<h3>Total Hours: 10.5 hours</h3>

<h3>What I'm Planning On Doing Next Week</h3>
<p>I will be designing a basic version of the third dungeon based on the depression and acceptance part of the stages of grief. I will also try to get more playtesting done this week.</p>

<h3>What I Discovered This Week</h3>
<p>I was very ill earlier in the week and unable to do a lot of work. Once again, when our team really needs it, we meet up to get the work done. However, we need to stop this cycle and actually work together.</p>

<h3>Asking and Giving Help</h3>
<p>Garrett helped me put together the PowerPoint for our pre-alpha presentation.</p>
