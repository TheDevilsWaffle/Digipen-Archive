<h4>Testing Reports:</h4>
<p>I held two informal playtests with friends from DigiPen and also coworkers from job at Starbucks:</p>
<strong>DigiPen Testers</strong>
	<p>Classmates from the Digipen, as well as fellow teammates, participated as testers, giving me their opinions on how the game played and if it matched what we are looking to convey with it.</p>
<strong>Name:</strong>					
 <ul>
 	<li>Jason Guelbert</li>
 	<li>Berne Capone</li>
 	<li>Eric Gleiser</li>
 	<li>Garret Huxtable</li>
 	<li>Auston Lindsey</li>
 	<li>Christopher Christensen</li>
 	<li>Maddie Santino </li>
 </ul>

<strong>Results</strong>
<p>Iâ€™ve come to rely on this group of people because they all give great responses and do not all agree with me or each other. I reserve the right to make my own decision, but the thoughts and opinions of the testing surely will be on my mind in future versions of developing. For the most part the biggest concern of all the playtesters is the confusion with how the controls for grappling works and also the extreme amount of dialog. They all agreed the game looks nice, but is just overall confusing.</p>
<strong>Non-DigiPen Testers</strong>
	<p>Non-Digipen friends participated as testers, giving me their opinions on how the game played and if it matched what we are looking to convey with it.</p>
<strong>Name:</strong>					
 <ul>
 	<li>Shaheene Moore</li>
 	<li>Alina Tkatz</li>
 	<li>Robin Wakimoto</li>
 	<li>Martha Stensland</li>
 	<li>Faith Legat</li>
 </ul>

<strong>Results</strong>
<p>Probably the best group of non-gamers I can find, the results from this test will be very useful, even if they are not good for the current state of the game. The game does not play well for these non-gamers. They are confused by the control layout, they are unsure what we are asking them to do, and they do not understand why there is so much text. Most of them gave up even trying to read the text after the third dialog box. We definitely need to trim content and ramp up the usability of this game.</p>
<h4>Notes:</h4>
<p>This milestone could have easily been a disaster and in some ways it should have been. There was not much new work done on the game during these 5 weeks. This is in due part to the team not showing up to the team meetings that we agreed upon. Eric and Jason are constantly making excuses for not showing up to school. Thankfully Eric does some work when not around us, but I have no idea what Jason has been up to. This presentation was thrown together incredibly last minute, but I'm glad we were able to do something before time was up. Somehow Eric seems to get a lot of the credit for this game when it comes to praise from the teachers, but without us constantly being there to keep him on track and providing support in the areas of art and other scripts I do not think we'd have anything to show.

<ul>
	<li><strong>Eric:</strong> Has only shown up to 2 meetings since the beginning of the semester. I know he only has this class and one other, but there's a serious lack of respect for the team when he does not take the time to be here with us. When he is here it helps out a lot and he definitely is talented at producing work quickly.</li>
	<li><strong>Garrett: Has already expressed interest in leaving the team and has a replacement team for next semester. Thankfully he told me he would stick around and finish out this game and he has been good about showing up to meetings, even if no one else does.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Jason: Where is he? What is he doing? I know he has health issues, but I do not know what is going on with him at all.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Travis: After refactoring the UI code and beginning work on the Burnt City dungeon I have found myself usually alone in the team space. I need to find motivation to continue on and carry out what good I can do for this game. I do not think I will stick around next semester for this team.</strong></li>
</ul>
