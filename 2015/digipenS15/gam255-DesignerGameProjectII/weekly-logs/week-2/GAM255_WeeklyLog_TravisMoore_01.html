<h3>Total Hours: 14 hours</h3>

<h3>What I'm Planning On Doing Next Week</h3>
<p>The UI refactor seems mostly complete. I will have to meet with Eric to consider what to do about mouse controls for the UI or if he thinks we should scrap that altogether. I will start working on the concept designs for the environment and characters that we will need.</p>

<h3>What I Discovered This Week</h3>
<p>I really enjoy doing UI work, but I'm ready for something new to work on.</p>

<h3>Asking and Giving Help</h3>
<p>No help asked or given to my teammates this week, but I did help Chris Christensen with his CG125 modeling homework.</p>
