<h3>What I'm Planning On Doing Next Week</h3>
<p>After getting approval for the layout for the Burnt City Dungeon I plan on creating a first pass in-engine for the Burnt City Dungeon.</p>

<h3>What I Discovered This Week</h3>
<p>I find myself getting in a nice rhythm for setting myself a goal for the day and accomplishing it. I plan on keeping myself organized by focusing on one goal at a time and slowly but surely completing my checklist for tasks on Trello.</p>

<h3>Asking and Giving Help</h3>
<p>Garrett provided me with help rigging my lamp for cg125. I gave opinions/advice to both Eric and Garrett.</p>
