<h3>Total Milestone Hours: 41.5</h3>
<h4>Notes:</h4>
<p>This milestone started out really strong after our team-on-one with Rachel, but slipped back into old habits after a week or two. Our team barely meets at all, but at least when a due date comes up we all pull together and get something going. I learned from the team-on-one that I should be more assertive about getting what I want completed for the game. My old habits were to try and get approval from everyone before starting on something that I think would work well for our game. This old habit did not work well with the team because getting everyone in the same room is almost impossible. Instead, I started creating the Burnt City Dungeon without approval and later posted on Trello the work that I had been doing. With the work already done, it did not matter so much if anyone liked the idea before, everyone was just glad to see something done. It's harder to turn down work that has been done than just an idea. Here's my team analysis.

<ul>
    <li><strong>Eric:</strong> Eric is a little bit better about showing up to school. Considering he has this class and one other, I would like to see him show up in the team space more. His outside life seems to affect his ability to show up to school. This being said, he always manages to get a lot of work done in a short period of time. He has been helping bring the Burnt City Dungeon to life by taking my layout and mechanics that I've designed and putting them in the engine. Overall I like working with Eric when he is around, but I've learned to not rely on him.</li>
    <li><strong>Garrett: Garrett shows up and gets the modeling done that he is asked to do. I suppose there is not much going on with the producer meetings lately because he does not communicate anything from them. We get along fine and I help him when he needs help, and vice-versa. I would work with him again in the future because he is reliable and always at school.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Jason: I've finally found out that Jason is having lots of personal issues this semester which is why he is never around. He started coming back to school the week of the milestone but his presense is probably temporary. In our team-on-one Rachel said that we should consider him to be not really here because of the personal reasons. I hope everything gets better for him soon.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Travis: I've learned a lot this milestone. I've been upset about having a fragmented team, but I've come to terms with this by simply accepting this for what it is. I've come out of this milestone with more concept art completed, level designs, and a direction for our game to take with the Burnt City Dungeon. I will keep moving forward with this and do the work I intend to complete for our game without feeling stalled for approval from our team. If they like what I've done great! If they do not, then I will modify it to their liking. Either way I will be working on making our game complete.</strong></li>
</ul>
