<h3>Total Hours: 7.5 hours</h3>

<h3>What I'm Planning On Doing Next Week</h3>
<p>I want to complete a paper prototype of the dungeon and finish the enemy mockups. Hopefully by the end of next week we'll have a good idea of what the Burnt City dungeon area will look like and a bunch of puzzles completed for it.</p>

<h3>What I Discovered This Week</h3>
<p>My negative attitude towards the team dynamic has been affecting others greatly. I will do my best to keep a positive attitude about our team instead of holding a grudge against people for not showing up.</p>

<h3>Asking and Giving Help</h3>
<p>I asked Eric for help in creating a "light puzzle" mechanic for the Burnt City dungeon.</p>
