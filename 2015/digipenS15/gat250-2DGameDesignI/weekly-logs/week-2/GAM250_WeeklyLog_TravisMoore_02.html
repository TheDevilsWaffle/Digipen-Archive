		<td>UI</td>
		<td>Functionality for submenus / quit confirmation menus. Also fixed a problem with mouse controls not animating properly on submenu transitions.</td>
		<td>4 hours</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>01/12/2015</td>
		<td>UI</td>
		<td>Created Pause Menus and Main Menu Confirmation menus, as well as their functionality. Most of the mouse related problems are fixed, but there is a slight bug with trying to repeat through submenus. Considering getting rid of functionality for mice altogther.</td>
		<td>3 hours</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>01/13/2015</td>
		<td>UI</td>
		<td>Quit Confirmation for main menu and for pause menus work perfectly for keyboard and mouse, but mouse only works on the first try. Repeated quit confirmations with the mouse causes issues. Also added scrolling credits.</td>
		<td>4 hours</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>01/14/2015</td>
		<td>Character/Camera Controller</td>
		<td>Started work on the character controller for my game. Added in keyboard and gamepad functionality for moving and jumping. Created a camera that scrolls with the player, giving the player some extra room to view what is in front of them. Also allowed the camera to zoom in if the player is idle.</td>
		<td>2 hours</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>01/14/2015</td>
		<td>Animation Controller</td>
		<td>Created an animation controller to switch out and play sprites for moving, idle, and jumping. I will eventually add a falling state. Should also work for enemies if needed.</td>
		<td>2 hours</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>01/xx/2015</td>
		<td>Falling Objects</td>
		<td>Added a work in progress script for falling objects. I am considering scrapping my initial idea and going with something simpler, because my initial idea may be too ambitious with the 2 weeks left to create this game.</td>
		<td>1 hour</td>

<h3>Total Hours: 16 hours</h3>

<h3>3&mdash;Biggest Risk</h3>
<p>With only 2 weeks left to design gameplay I may have to rethink what my game actually will be. My initial idea seems too large to pull off in the little bit of time I have left.</p>

<h3>4&mdash;Risk Mitigation</h3>
<p>I will be exploring new concepts over the weekend. By lab on Tuesday I will have a laundry list of things needed for the new idea.</p>
