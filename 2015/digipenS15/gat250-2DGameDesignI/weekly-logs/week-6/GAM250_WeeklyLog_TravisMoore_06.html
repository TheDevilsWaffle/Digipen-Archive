		<td>UI - Updated Screens / Buttons</td>
		<td>Created new art assets for digipen, zero engine, start, &amp; credits screens. Also changed the way buttons work a bit.</td>
		<td>2 hours</td>

	<tr>
		<td>02/09/2015</td>
		<td>UI - Refining How To Play</td>
		<td>Refined the how to play, objective, flinging, and control diagram art assets. They should all be the same size. Had to hard code in positioning so they all appear to be on the same position. Cleaned up the script by removing redundancy.</td>
		<td>1.5 hours</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>02/10/2015</td>
		<td>Scripting - Colliders and Script Refining</td>
		<td>Updated the collision bounds on bodies to be simpler rectangles instead of multi-convex mesh colliders. Because of this I had to revisit the flinging mechanics. The script is now tighter and bodies do not sometimes fall through the floor.</td>
		<td>1 hours</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>02/10/2015</td>
		<td>UI &amp; Scripting - Credits</td>
		<td>Cleaned up the credits layout and how scrolling works.</td>
		<td>1 hours</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>02/11/2015</td>
		<td>Brainstorming for Project 2</td>
		<td>Brainstorming for a new project 2. Going to try and find a way to use existing mechanics and art assets but in a puzzle game. Played puzzle games and tweaked 2D camera controls.</td>
		<td>2.5 hours</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>02/11/2015</td>
		<td>Scripting - Vibration Controller</td>
		<td>Experimenting with gamepad vibration feedback. Created a quick Vibration Controller that can be passed time and intensity to affect the gamepad.</td>
		<td>0.5 hours</td>

<h3>Total Hours: ERASE THIS ON SUNDAY 8.5 hours</h3>

<h3>Biggest Risk</h3>
<p>Still need a solid concept so I know what gameplay to program.</p>

<h3>Risk Mitigation</h3>
<p>Giving myself the weekend to come up with a concept and then I will shop the idea to the professor on Wednesday.</p>
