<h3>Total Hours: 12 hours</h3>

<h3>3&mdash;Biggest Risk</h3>
<p>Creating the UI for the game is taking more time than I initially expected. However, the results look great, and they should cut down the time needed for future projects.</p>

<h3>4&mdash;Biggest Risk</h3>
<p>After completing the submenus and pause menus I will consider the UI complete for now and start working on gameplay. At the max, I will give myself 6 more hours to complete the UI elements.</p>
