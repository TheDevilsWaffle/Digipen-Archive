		<td>Design + Scripting</td>
		<td>Started sketching out the look for my level select screen. I'm planning on adding collectible cubes in each level along with a timer to track how fast a player has beaten a level.

<h3>Total Hours: 3 hours</h3>

<h3>Biggest Risk</h3>
<p>I need to quickly figure out which game I'll be refining for project 3.</p>

<h3>Risk Mitigation</h3>
<p>I'll be picking one game based on my playtests outside of school by Sunday to refine for project 3.</p>
