		<td>Sound + Scripting</td>
		<td>Created cube pickup noise in bfxr. Added it into the game as an mp3 soundcue. Created detection for it upon sollision with a cube. Added it to the sfx controller script. Also added inbetween level recap music that will vary in pitch based on how many cubes were collected in the level.</td>

		<td>Trying to get this data saving down, but it is difficult. Finally I think I got this down to a point where it initializes data and resaves on top of it. Further work on the level recap level is created and appears to be working.</td>

		<td>Testing + Scripting</td>
		<td>Level recap testing proves it is working! Woo! Working on creating conditions where text pulsates based on improving over your last time.</td>
		<td>4 hours</td>

		<td>04/09/2015</td>
		<td>Testing + Scripting</td>
		<td>Starting work on the level select menu. Reworking animations and data transfer for this level. It works and locks levels if they are locked via their data comp9onent. Need to hook up the rest of the levels like level 01 is.</td>
		<td>4 hours</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>04/10/2015</td>
		<td>Testing + Minor fixes</td>
		<td>Testing all aspects of the menu system including the new level select menu and the end level recap. Fixing minor problems. It seems all I have left to do is hook up the existing levels with the cubes and scripts needed to track things and create new levels.</td>
		<td>1.5 hours</td>

<h3>Total Hours: 15 hours</h3>

<h3>Biggest Risk</h3>
<p>There can never be enough testing and I still need to make new levels. I have yet to implement an in-game HUD and I have a feeling I'll need to do that in order to have accomplishment in a satisfying manner.</p>

<h3>Risk Mitigation</h3>
<p>This shouls be the final class that I have work to do for next week from Wednesday until it is due on Sunday. This should be enough time to get everything where it needs to be without having any other distractions.</p>
