		<td>Game Theme / Scripting - Multiplayer</td>
		<td>A little late, but I decided to scrap my original idea of incorporating project 1 into a mental challenge game. It just did not work well and required too much physical challenge. I am now doing a game similar to <em>Ibb & Obb</em>, which requires controlling 2 game characters with the same controller or playing with a friend. I added dual gamepad support and created a detection script for multiplayer or single player depending on gamepad detection.</td>
		<td>2 hours</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>02/24/2015</td>
		<td>Scripting - Controls</td>
		<td>Working on getting the controls for controlling both players right. I might need to make them simpler than what it is now. Looking into seeing if I can get the right analog stick to work or if I should just stick to using the DPad for the second character.</td>
		<td>1.5 hours</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>02/25/2015</td>
		<td>Scripting - Controls</td>
		<td>Completed the character(s) controls, multiplayer detection, and started gameplay scripting with buttons that control gates.</td>
		<td>2 hours</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>02/25/2015</td>
		<td>Scripting - Gameplay Mechanics</td>
		<td>Added gravity switching buttons, refined the buttons that control open/close gates, refined the player controls, playtested the player controls, and I am now working on extending the button functionality to other button types based on enums.</td>
		<td>6.5 hours</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>02/26/2015</td>
		<td>Scripting - Gameplay Mechanics</td>
		<td>Gravity buttons and their corresponding gravity zones are now functioning properly. Not going to lie, this is pretty awesome to play with and very "Portal-like".</td>
		<td>1 hours</td>

		<td>02/28/2015</td>
		<td>Scripting - Gameplay Mechanics</td>
		<td>Started work on buttons that extend and retract bridges</td>
		<td>0.5 hours</td>

	<tr>
		<td>03/02/2015</td>
		<td>Scripting - Gameplay Mechanics</td>
		<td>Buttons now animate correctly upside down and are now part of the button itself.</td>
		<td>0.5 hours</td>

	<tr>
		<td>03/02/2015</td>
		<td>Scripting - Gameplay Mechanics</td>
		<td>Bridges extend and retract with animation that changes their Z-depth, size, and scale.</td>
		<td>1.5 hours</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>03/02/2015</td>
		<td>Scripting - Gameplay Mechanics</td>
		<td>Death zones, explosive death scripts, jumping dust particles, and bouncepads that are linked to buttons.</td>
		<td>4 hours</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>03/04/2015</td>
		<td>Design &amp; Cleanup</td>
		<td>Aesthetics design started, some script cleanup, and archetypes created.</td>
		<td>1.5 hours</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>03/05/2015</td>
		<td>Scripting - Corpse Decaying</td>
		<td>Work on resubmission for project 1: created a script that tracks the state of corpses and updates them from fresh->rotting->decaying->decayed. Skeleton assets started, as well.</td>
		<td>1.5 hours</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>03/06/2015</td>
		<td>Scripting - Corpse Decaying &amp; Physics</td>
		<td>Decaying corpses now working as intended. Corpses start to rot and then decay before finally coming a decayed pile. Still need to fix the physics materials on the bodies and figure out how collision works with planting the shovel.</td>
		<td>1.5 hours</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>03/06/2015</td>
		<td>WHAT</td>
		<td>Fixed the shovel not flipping properly left and right and also changed the physics for corpses. Added a corpse tracking script to drop bodies upon scoring points.</td>
		<td>1 hours</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>03/06/2015</td>
		<td>Art / Scripting / Bugs</td>
		<td>Created art asset for highligting the currently targeted corpse, created the script to create and destroy the highlight for the targeted corpse, fixed a minor glitch where the player could potentially fling a corpse through the tilemap, and finished corpse tracking script to drop more bodies as the player's score gets higher.</td>
		<td>2 hours</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>03/07/2015</td>
		<td>Scripting</td>
		<td>Added to the corpse tracker script so that it will destroy corpses that go out of bounds. Exported a version for playtesting.</td>
		<td>0.5 hours</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>03/07/2015</td>
		<td>Rubric / Bug Fixing</td>
		<td>Completed rubric, fixed bug where targeted corpse could turn into a decayed pile and trap the player or crash. Adjusted minor things like positioning for text and camera.</td>
		<td>1 hours</td>

<h3>Total Hours: 28.5 hours</h3>

<h3>Biggest Risk</h3>
<p>There's still a lot of mechanics to work out, but with a solid theme in place at least I now know what I'm working on. There is still a lot to do, such as creating the art assets, finding audio, creating levels, and refining things as a whole.</p>

<h3>Risk Mitigation</h3>
<p>Started a trello checklist to keep track of the laundry list of things to do. Going to try to complete and refine all mechanics over the spring break so that I can playtest them during the following week's lab. The last area I will be focusing on is aesthetics.</p>
