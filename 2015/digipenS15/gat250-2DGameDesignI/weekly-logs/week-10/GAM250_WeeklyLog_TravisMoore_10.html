		<td>Scripting</td>
		<td>Major clean up for scripts. Got rid of all project 1 scripts from the game that are not needed. Fixed Multiplayer Detection, but still need to test it again just to make sure. Fixed the way the camera lerps so that it finds a good position between both players. Fixed the way that portals work so they detect both players before loading the next level.</td>

<h3>Total Hours: 4 hours</h3>

<h3>Biggest Risk</h3>
<p>There's still a lot to do, but the mechanics seem complete. I need to create the levels and finish the art assets and audio assets before this game is ready to submit.</p>

<h3>Risk Mitigation</h3>
<p>Started writing out levels on paper and created a progression of teaching mechanics and the overall theme. Just need to translate it all into the engine. I did not get to work much on the game this week, but it will be the highest priority for this week.</p>
