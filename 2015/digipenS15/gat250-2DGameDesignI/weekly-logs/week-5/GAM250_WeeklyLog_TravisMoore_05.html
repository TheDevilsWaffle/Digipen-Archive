	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>02/02/2015</td>
		<td>Art Assets - Fling Arrow</td>
		<td>Created an arrow to indicate which direction the player can fling the bodies in.</td>
		<td>0.5 hours</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>02/02/2015</td>
		<td>Scripting - Fling Arrow</td>
		<td>First pass at having the fling arrow appear only upon press and hold of fling button, destroys upon flinging the body. Seems to be working fine.</td>
		<td>2 hours</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>02/02/2015</td>
		<td>Scripting - Power Meter refining</td>
		<td>Fixing the way the power meter displays. Now the power meter only displays when the fling button is held, charging now correctly starts at 0 instead of 50%.</td>
		<td>1.5 hours</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>02/03/2015</td>
		<td>Scripting - HUD Game Timer and Points</td>
		<td>Created a game timer that counts down how long the game round is. Also created a way to track the players score and implemented unique scoring for different bodies</td>
		<td>2.5 hours</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>02/03/2015</td>
		<td>Scripting - Countdown Timer</td>
		<td>An attempt to generate anticipation at the start of my game. The goal of the countdown timer is to count from 3 to 0 and then say "go" so that the player has a moment of intensity build up. Currently this thing is incredibly broken.</td>
		<td>2.5 hours</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>02/03/2015</td>
		<td>Scripting - Game Over Menu</td>
		<td>I need a way to send the player to the main menu after a game is over or restart the game. Currently this still needs work, but it does pop up if the game is over, so that's good.</td>
		<td>1 hours</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>02/04/2015</td>
		<td>Scripting - Countdown Timer Refining</td>
		<td>Struggling to make this work, I may have to drop the "pause game" idea of it while the timer is trying to countdown. Countdown timer works but no longer pauses the game before it starts.</td>
		<td>2.5 hours</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>02/04/2015</td>
		<td>Scripting - Body Spawner Changes</td>
		<td>Bodies now fall in random intervals between a min and max time. Bodies also do not start falling until after the countdown is over.</td>
		<td>1 hours</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>02/04/2015</td>
		<td>Scripting - Camera Changes</td>
		<td>Current playtesting shows that the camera moving after the shovel plants is disorienting to players. I have disabled camera lerping when the player is planted.</td>
		<td>0.5 hours</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>02/05/2015</td>
		<td>Scripting - HUD Added Time Text</td>
		<td>Added scripts to add time if a body is scored to encourage getting points to extend the game. Text pops up in the right place but is not fully animated yet.</td>
		<td>2 hours</td>
	</tr>

		<td>Scripting - HUD Added Time Text</td>
		<td>Added scripts to add time if a body is scored to encourage getting points to extend the game. Text pops up in the right place but is not fully animated yet.</td>
		<td>1.5 hours</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>02/05/2015</td>
		<td>Scripting - Restarting</td>
		<td>Added the ability to restart the main game level. This will be useful if bugs pop up, like the player losing the ability to plant the shovel.</td>
		<td>0.5 hours</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>02/06/2015</td>
		<td>Art Assets &amp; Level Design</td>
		<td>Created art assets for the level itself, inccluding the ground the player is on and decorative elements like grass and iron rod/spikes. Also created a background graphic. Fixed issues with colliding with the tilemap and also added these assets to the game and altered the level design a bit.</td>
		<td>3 hours</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>02/07/2015</td>
		<td>Final Touches</td>
		<td>Too many things to list out, basically everything that I haven't done yet</td>
		<td>12 hours</td>
	</tr>
