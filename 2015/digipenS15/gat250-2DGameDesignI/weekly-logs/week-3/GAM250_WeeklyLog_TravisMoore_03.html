<h3>Total Hours: 20 hours</h3>

<h3>Biggest Risk</h3>
<p>Scope might be an issue as I'm still working on gameplay to have this game completed. Despite spending quite a lot of time on this game my progress has not been as quick as I would like. I have a lot to learn when it comes to scripting, but I am determined to make a quality product.</p>

<h3>Risk Mitigation</h3>
<p>I will need to ask for more help instead of using large chunks of time trying to figure things out on my own. I am also considering cutting a lot of my original ideas out of the game. My plan is to have the gameplay completed by the end of the week in its simplest state.</p>
