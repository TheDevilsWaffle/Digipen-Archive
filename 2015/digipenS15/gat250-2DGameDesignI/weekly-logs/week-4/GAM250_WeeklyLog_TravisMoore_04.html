		<td>01/26/2015</td>
		<td>Gameplay - Joints</td>
		<td>Attempting to make my corpses have ragdoll-like properties by experimenting with joints in Zero Engine.</td>
		<td>2 hours</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>01/27/2015</td>
		<td>Art - Player</td>
		<td>Created the art asset to be used for the player's character (gravekeeper) along with the shovel that they will use to fling corpses.</td>
		<td>2 hours</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>01/27/2015</td>
		<td>Gameplay - Flinging Mechanics</td>
		<td>Corpses are properly flinging about when the player plants their shovel by pressing and holding "x". The bodies are flung upon release of the "x" button. I am running into an issue where multiple corpses colliding with the shovel can cause this script to function incorrectly.</td>
		<td>4.5 hours</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>01/28/2015</td>
		<td>Art - Coffins</td>
		<td>Created the art asset for coffins. They will be used for corpse collection for points.</td>
		<td>1 hours</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>01/28/2015</td>
		<td>Gameplay - Coffin and Corpse Detection for Points</td>
		<td>Created the script that will detect particular corpses and allocate points to the player depending on which corpse it collects.</td>
		<td>1.5 hours</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>01/28/2015</td>
		<td>SFX - BFXR</td>
		<td>Downloaded BFXR to help create self-made sounds for the game. Not sure if this is what I would like in the end, but it works for now.</td>
		<td>1.5 hours</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>01/29/2015</td>
		<td>Gameplay - Variable Strength and Direction</td>
		<td>Amazing progress in that now the player's strength of the fling is variable depending on when the "x" button is released. Also, the direction of the fling is now based on the "left stick" direction held on the gamepad. This is a lot of fun.</td>
		<td>3.5 hours</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>01/30/2015</td>
		<td>Art - Strength Meter</td>
		<td>Created the art asset for the strength meter so that the player has visual feedback of how much strength they will have when they release the "x" button.</td>
		<td>2 hours</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>01/30/2015</td>
		<td>Gameplay - Strength Meter Script</td>
		<td>Created a script that scales the meter up and down using the art assets for the strength meter. Tested this in game and it works beautifully.</td>
		<td>2.5 hours</td>

<h3>Total Hours: 20.5 hours</h3>

<h3>Biggest Risk</h3>
<p>The hardest parts of the gameplay are complete, but there is still a lot needed to finish this game. I will have to cut a bunch of what I want to complete this game with the very core of what is needed. Art and HUD elements are still needed.</p>

<h3>Risk Mitigation</h3>
<p>GAT250 will be the biggest priority for the week with all spare time going towards completing the very core basics needed to turn this in on time. Polish will be secondary.</p>
