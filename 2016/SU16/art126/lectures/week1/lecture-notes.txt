IN-CLASS: Introduction; “buy supplies—especially paper and charcoal and conte and erasers BY NEXT WEEK!!!; syllabus, etc.

DEMO: composition lecture (see notes below)

MATERIALS NEEDED: sketchbooks; pencils; erasers

HOMEWORK: 50 (25 VERTICAL/25 HORIZONTAL) COMPOSITION THUMBNAILS (ASSIGNED; DUE IN 1 WEEK).  HOMEWORK WEEK #1: draw 50, 4" to 5” (approximately!) “Super Thumbs” 

of exactly three, simple geometric shapes from life.  Make 25 vertical and 25 horizontal picture planes.  These objects can be anything simple: a cereal box, a glass jar and a pingpong ball, but you 

must use these same three objects through the entire assignment (note: keep these three objects because you will use them for two more assignments).  Light these with a strong light an use the 

shadows to create values that help make your compositions more intersting.  Do not work from photos and do not fictionalize any part of any drawing.  No cropping of any object or shadow or any 

part of any object or shadow.  Use three different linear values and do not blend or smudge any marks.  Keep your drawings clean!

THINGS TO LOOK FOR WHEN DRAWING:

Question: what kinds of shadows are you looking at?

Question:   where is the light source and what direction is the light pointing in?

Question:  how strong is the light source and how does the strength of the light effect the shadows?

REMEMBER: you are drawing the effect of light and you are using the value in those shadows as graphic weight in your picture plane to help compose the picture.

REMEMBER: Always use a picture plane!  Consider your compositions!!!  Avoid symmetry or overly-centered compositions.

REMEMBER: use your (Art 101) perspective drawing to help keep these quick drawings a little more accurate and realistic looking!

REMEMBER: you are composing light’s effects.

REMEMBER: DRAW WHAT YOU SEE, NOT WHAT YOU THINK YOU SEE!!!


 
Principles of Visual Composition & Design
Visual Composition – def.   The placement or arrangement of visual elements or ingredients in a work of art, as distinct from the subject of a work.   It can also be thought of as the organization of the elements of art according to the principles of art.

Illusionism vs. Formalism-   Put simply, Illusionist Art is in service to representation, whereas Formalist Art is in service to purely visual elements.  Realist vs. Abstract Art would be another way of stating it.  The principles of composition apply to both.  In this class we will be learning how to talk about and work with visual images in purely “Formal” terms; assessing them based on the visual language from which they are formed.   

~ Please note:  “Art” is not an object, any more than writing is.    Art is a visual language. ~ 

 

Some Terms & Concepts

-Focal Point – Central Focus, Split focus, diffuse focus

-Shape and Proportion- Organic, geometric, relative size

-Positioning or Orientation of the elements within a composition.  Balance. 

-Leading the Eye- Composing elements to direct how the viewer’s eye moves through the image.

-Field of View- Cropping the picture plane.  (Where you choose to put the borders.)

-Viewpoint- Choosing the viewer’s positioning or “perspective”.

-Negative and Positive Space-  Also, Object/Ground.

-Color- Warm and Cool, Primary, Complimentary, Secondary, Harmonies, Saturation, Pastel.

-Value/Contrast- Dark & Light, their juxtaposition and gradation.

-Geometry-  Symmetry, Asymmetry, Horizontal, vertical, diagonal, Rectangular, Triangular, circular, Spiral, Rule of Thirds, Rule of Odds

-Line- Contour, line weight, straight, curved, organic,  linear value, 

-Rhythm- Repetition, pattern

-Illumination – Lighting

-Perspective- Space/depth.  Viewpoint:  One, two or three point perspective.

-Simplification- Reducing clutter or detail in an image to heighten the impact of the main element(s).

-Rule of Odds- Theory that (visually speaking) Odd numbered groupings are more interesting than even numbered groupings.  

-Rule of Thirds-  A simplification of the Fibonnacci Series and Golden Mean, that divides the picture plane into 3rds, holding that aligning key elements of a composition with these divisions helps to create a pleasing harmony.  (Take this with a grain of salt please).

-Anxiety vs. Comfort- States of Safety.   Balance/imbalance.  DRAMA

- Avoiding Symmetry- unless symmetry is primary to what you are communicating.

-Breaking the “Rules” of composition.  In service to the desired effect.  



ELEMENTS OF DESIGN:  Line, Shape, Color, Texture, Value, Form, Space, Depth.

Visual Design is the way a piece of artwork, a room, yard, video game, photo or other artistic subject is composed and appeals to the human eye.
