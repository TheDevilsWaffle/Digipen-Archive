PERSONAL NOTES:
	This project really took off once I stepped up and really took charge of moving it forward,
	in a producer's role. I learned a lot about teamwork and conflict resolution. 
	Even though I didn't initially like coding at all, I really had to step up and 
	monopolize it, and I think I've learned a lot from it. I'm happy with the game
	we made and especially so due to the setbacks we encountered.
