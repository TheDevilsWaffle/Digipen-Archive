Personal Notes:

What worked well for our team was the harsh slap of reality.
Realizing we were way behind and that we needed to double time it!
Our team started off in a bad place. Maybe some more friendly and
stress free team exercise courses would help solidify team work better.
I have learned a lot during this process. I have learned that
Coding is an absolute essential skill for anyone working in the
industry. I have also sharpened my skills using illustrator and 
animating. If there is one thing I need to take away from this, it
would be to not overscope and begin working on the game product
as soon as possible. Theorizing an idea is only so effective.
