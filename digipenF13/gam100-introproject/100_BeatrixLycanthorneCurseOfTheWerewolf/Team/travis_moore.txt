Personal Notes -
	I certainly learned a lot making this game. I've never done programming
	for games before, and did not know any python or game engines before
	undertaking this project. It was definitely a struggle because my team
	had also no experience in doing these things, as well. We had quite a
	falling out due to lack of communication and me taking on too much
	responsibility up until the last couple of weeks. Thankfully, our team
	was mostly able to pull together to create what we could in the little
	time we had left.
	I think our game could have been better had we not struggled so early
	on in the creation of it, but I'm glad we were able to do as much as we
	have. I hope you'll appreciate our efforts and our ability to rally
	together and become a team once more in order to finish our game.
	Thank you.
