PLAYTEST REPORT

General
-Get some direction (signs) and a tutorial. People are confused about what to do and how to do it
-Make it more obvious where to go
-The level seems to be too hard, either due to lack of direction, lack of collider, or lack of normalized speed
-Make sure the "where to jump to" can be seen onscreen please //////DONE//////

Specific
-Get the mouse thing working for the front menu--it's not very intuitive, apparently
-Normalize the speed
-Fix that collider!!!
-Fix second minecart puzzle so you can't jump up without pushing the cart over
-"People might abuse the werewolf state"
	-I'm thinking either we get a cooldown working or we give them a set number of transformations or something
	-People seem to lean towards a cooldown timer

These were the biggest things I noticed. I had a 13 year old play, a 9 year old, and an 11 year old. Pretty good results, considering.
